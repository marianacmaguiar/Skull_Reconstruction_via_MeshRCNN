<h3> Abstract</h3> <br>
<p>The evolution of modern medicine and the technologies of implant design and manufacturing have allowed the number of cranioplasties performed to increase greatly, improving the quality of life of patients who have to undergo cranial reconstruction surgery. The need to generate cranial implants adapted to the individuality of each human skull as quickly and efficiently as possible has led in recent years to the search for methods that are as automated as possible and do not compromise the quality and integrity of the implant.</p>
<p>The most traditional and popular method in recent years has been to use CAD/CAM technologies, in which patient-specific cranial implants can be reliably generated. However, the process is time-consuming, and the available software has high associated costs that require skilled professionals for implant design, not allowing it to be available in all clinical settings. </p>
<p>Due to the growing interest and success of the application of Deep Learning to 3D reconstruction, recently several works have been proposed on the application of these architectures to cranial reconstruction, allowing to obtain high-quality cranial implants automatically, not only reducing the cost of the process but also enabling its availability in a larger number of clinical contexts. </p>
<p>The work proposed in this thesis focused on the possibility of applying 3D Deep Learning to skull reconstruction where a 2D-3D system was implemented whose goal was to generate a mesh-shaped skull implant from its 2D image of the skull with the skull ready for 3D printing defect. The system includes several interconnected neural networks that enable 2D perception of the skull shape and its 3D reconstruction. </p>
